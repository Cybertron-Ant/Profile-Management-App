## 1. Authentication
Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the app.

### Measures:
- Use Firebase Authentication for secure login and signup.
- Support multiple authentication methods:
  - Email/password.
  - Social login (Google, Facebook).
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.

### Best Practices:
- Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) in environment variables or secure storage.
- Use strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
- Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms.

## 2. Authorization
Authorization ensures that users can only access resources they are permitted to.

### Measures:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC):
  - **Admin**: Full access to all features.
  - **User**: Limited access to personal data and features.
- Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict access to Firestore and Firebase Storage.

### Example: Firebase Security Rules

```javascript
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Data Encryption
Encryption ensures that sensitive data is protected both at rest and in transit.

### Measures:
- Use HTTPS for all API communication.
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info) using AES-256.
- Use Firebase’s built-in encryption for Firestore and Firebase Storage.

### Best Practices:
- Never store plaintext passwords; always use hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
- Regularly rotate encryption keys.
- Use secure storage solutions (e.g., `flutter_secure_storage`) for local data.

## 4. Input Validation
Input validation ensures that user inputs are safe and conform to expected formats.

### Measures:
- Validate all user inputs on both the client and server sides.
- Use regular expressions for format validation (e.g., email, phone number).
- Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Example: Email Validation

```dart
bool isValidEmail(String email) {
  final regex = RegExp(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$');
  return regex.hasMatch(email);
}
```

## 5. Secure Storage
Secure storage ensures that sensitive data is protected on the device.

### Measures:
- Use `flutter_secure_storage` for storing sensitive data (e.g., tokens, keys).
- Avoid storing sensitive data in SharedPreferences or Hive without encryption.

### Example: Secure Storage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';

final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();

// Store data
await storage.write(key: 'token', value: 'your_token');

// Retrieve data
String? token = await storage.read(key: 'token');
```

## 6. Network Security
Network security ensures that data transmitted over the network is protected.

### Measures:
- Use HTTPS for all API communication.
- Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Use secure libraries (e.g., `dio`, `http`) for network requests.

### Example: Certificate Pinning

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:dio_certificate_pinning/dio_certificate_pinning.dart';

final dio = Dio();
dio.interceptors.add(CertificatePinningInterceptor(allowedSHAFingerprints: ['your_fingerprint']));
```

## 7. Monitoring and Incident Response
Monitoring ensures that security incidents are detected and responded to promptly.

### Measures:
- Use Firebase Crashlytics and Sentry for error tracking.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).
- Regularly review logs and audit trails.

### Best Practices:
- Have an incident response plan in place.
- Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.

## 9. Security Best Practices
- **Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies and libraries up to date.
- **User Education**: Educate users about security best practices (e.g., strong passwords, phishing).
- **Compliance**: Ensure the app complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
